# Project Title

CLI ToDo List

## Description

A simple command-line todo list manager

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Golang

### Executing program

The project can be run via terminal/cmd.
```
go build todo_list.go
main
```
or
```
go run todo_list.go
```

## Project Features

* The project is a simple CLI-based ToDo List application.
* When you close the project, it saves the .gob file in the current directory, allowing you to continue where you left off when you open it again.
* For now, there are options to add a task, mark a task as completed, mark a task as not completed, show tasks, and save tasks.


I aim to continue the project in the future.
